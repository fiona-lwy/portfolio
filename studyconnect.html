                <p>There are many approaches to help the students to learn better. Study Blue provides a tool for user
                    to create and share flash cards to memorize the terms. It has an alarm reminder to bring the user
                    back to take a certain flashcard test. However, the shared resources are limited - only those from
                    the hot
                    subjects in the university.</p>
                <p>Study Buddy is like an online classroom. It focuses on the questions the
                    students have. Provided by the interactive whiteboard, students can have a
                    meeting with the tutors, but there are no resources to share. Also, the subjects are limited to
                    science and math only.</p>
                <p>Think Binder provides a platform combining the functions of resource sharing and video chat room.
                    Yet, the social-like feed dashboard may make it become a social platform instead of learning
                    platform. Also, the video chat may involve porn.

                -Define the goal of the app - resource sharing, discussion or scheduling for a meeting<br>
                -Able to know the userâ€™s credibility is important for the users when they want to meet a
                stranger<br>
                -Share resources<br>
                -If it has a resources library, make sure it has a broad coverage of different subjects<br>
                -Users should be able to pick up a meeting time that is available for all parties<br>
                -Users should be able to check the meeting request status anytime<br>
                -Avoid making the app become a messaging or dating app

                <p class="bold subtitle2">II. USER SURVEY</p>
                <p class="bold">82% of the participants study alone</p>
                <p>27.8% of them reflected that they could not find anyone to study with.</p>
                <p class="bold">18% of the participants study with their friends</p>
                <p>All of them choose to study with friends because it motivates each other and allows the exchange of
                    resources and learning materials. 75% of them thought that friends may help when they have questions
                    and they can have a deep discussion and explore more on some topics.</p>
                <p>However, they are frustrated when it comes to schedule a meeting with friends. For instance, no
                    response from friends, difficult to come up a date with busy people and no meeting reminder. All of
                    them hope that a study group app could solve these problems.</p>
                <p class="bold">Concerns about the study group app</p>
                <p>Participants do not mind to study with strangers, but they have some concerns on the quality of peers
                    whether they are at the same level and 25% of the survey participants mind if the peers are not
                    studying in the same subject.</p>

        <div class="container2">
            <p>54.5% of them worried if the app becomes a dating app. 36.4% of them
                worried about getting ditched and 31.8% of them would like to know the stranger better because it is
                risky and dangerous.</p>
            <p class="bold">Assumptions</p>
            <p>Some assumptions have been made on the study place. After reviewing the survey result, we learn that the
                potential users usually go to other places to study instead of cafe. That changed the features that I
                planned to have, so we would leave the meeting venue open for users to fill in, instead of filtering the
                coffee shops location on a Google map. We learn to not make any assumptions at the early stage of
                research.</p>

                <p class="bold subtitle2">I. COLOR</p>
            </p>
            <p>We decided to use soft tone of blue to deliver a casual feeling. In order to give it more energy, we also
                chose
                orange which is a warm color as a secondary color.</p>

            <h5>Color section of Style Guide</h5>
            <p>Using monochromatic would be too boring and the contrast of orange and blue would be too sharp, so I
                reduced
                the hue of them to bring a softer look.</p>
            <p>
                <p class="bold subtitle2">II. TYPOGRAPHY</p>
            </p>
            <p> For the typography, we chose Vidaloka for the headings because it has academic and grand feelings. For
                the body, we used Assistant as it has enough spacing between each character that is able to display the
                most important information like the scheduled date and time clearly.</p>

            <p>Option 3 looks too commercial. Option 2 and 4 were the potential logos. We chose to refine option 2
                because a square logo is more readable and clearer when it zooms out.</p>
            <p>To present an academic feeling, we added a simple badge around the book.</p>

                <p>During this process, there are many challenges encountered and lots of iterations involved. Here
                    below we show three of them.</p>
                <p class="bold subtitle2">I. BUTTON STYLE</p>
                <p>We tried to use square for the CTA buttons and sign up. However, it looks a bit too serious. To
                    deliver a casual brand image, we changed them to rounded buttons.</p>

                <div class="styling">

                <p class="bold subtitle2">II. THE CURRENT LOCATION</p>
                <p>In order to help the users to know which page they are on, we highlighted the current menu item which
                    looks different from the rest of the menu.</p>

                <div class="styling">
                    <figure>

                <p class="bold subtitle2">III. ADDING A HOME LINK</p>
                <p>Users will land to the homepage after they sign in or sign up an account. However, there is no link
                    to go back to the homepage when the user nagivates to other pages. To solve this, we added a "HOME"
                    link on the nagviation bar to bring the users back to the homepage to have an overview of the
                    confirmed and pending meetings, and friend's shared resources.</p>

                <h3>USABILITY TESTS</h3>
            </div>
            <p>In the usability test, we tested the processes of <span class="bold">sign-up</span>, <span
                    class="bold">checking a friend's schedule</span> and <span class="bold">requesting for a
                    meeting</span>.</p>
            <p>The result has a very high success rate. The testers understood the flow and completed the tests without
                any difficulty. The only opinion is that the logo or homepage link should usually be placed on top left
                corner while the rest of the menu item should be placed on the right.
            </p>
            <p>It is seen as one's preference. We do not see a big issue there because there are websites putting logo
                at the center and the menu items on the sides.</p>

                    <p class="bold subtitle2">SOLUTION</p>
                </p>
                <p>Users can now search new study peers. By checking the profile, users can have a better expectation
                    and download the learning materials.</p>
                <p>Also, provided with friend's schedule, user can quickly come out a date, request a meeting with them
                    and check who is/are going.</p>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold subtitle2">IMPROVEMENT?</p>
                </p>
                <p>To highlight the dates that already have meetings on top of the calendar image, I had to bold the
                    numbers in order to cover the meeting dates on the image.
                    If I have more time, I would create the calendar myself to make sure it covers the date properly.
                </p>
                <p>Also, I would think more about the scheduling flow with a person. Can the user
                    select a date that the person is not available? Maybe that person would like to rearrange the
                    schedule for the user? To keep things simple, we decided to let the user only select the date that
                    the person is available. For now, the only solution is, if the user really wanted to meet the
                    person, he or she could select a date that matches to the personâ€™s schedule and leave a note, 
                    requesting for an arrangement.</p>
