                    <p>There are many approaches to help the students to learn better. Study Blue provides a tool
                        for
                        user
                        to create and share flash cards to memorize the terms. It has an alarm reminder to bring the
                        user
                        back to take a certain flashcard test. However, the shared resources are limited - only
                        those
                        from
                        the hot
                        subjects in the university.</p>
                    <p>Study Buddy is like an online classroom. It focuses on the questions the
                        students have. Provided by the interactive whiteboard, students can have a
                        meeting with the tutors, but there are no resources to share. Also, the subjects are limited
                        to
                        science and math only.</p>
                    <p>Think Binder provides a platform combining the functions of resource sharing and video chat
                        room.
                        Yet, the social-like feed dashboard may make it become a social platform instead of learning
                        platform. Also, the video chat may involve porn.

                <p>
                    -Define the goal of the app - resource sharing, discussion or scheduling for a meeting<br>
                    -Able to know the user’s credibility is important for the users when they want to meet a
                    stranger<br>
                    -Share resources<br>
                    -If it has a resources library, make sure it has a broad coverage of different subjects<br>
                    -Users should be able to pick up a meeting time that is available for all parties<br>
                    -Users should be able to check the meeting request status anytime<br>
                    -Avoid making the app become a messaging or dating app

                    <p><span class="paragraph--title">82% of the participants study alone</span></p>
                    <p>27.8% of them reflected that they could not find anyone to study with.</p>
                    <p><span class="paragraph--title">18% of the participants study with their friends</span></p>
                    <p>All of them choose to study with friends because it motivates each other and allows the
                        exchange
                        of
                        resources and learning materials. 75% of them thought that friends may help when they have
                        questions
                        and they can have a deep discussion and explore more on some topics.</p>
                    <p>However, they are frustrated when it comes to schedule a meeting with friends. For instance,
                        no
                        response from friends, difficult to come up a date with busy people and no meeting reminder.
                        All
                        of
                        them hope that a study group app could solve these problems.</p>
                    <p><span class="paragraph--title">Concerns about the study group app</span></p>
                    <p>Participants do not mind to study with strangers, but they have some concerns on the quality
                        of
                        peers
                        whether they are at the same level and 25% of the survey participants mind if the peers are
                        not
                        studying in the same subject.</p>

                <p>54.5% of them worried if the app becomes a dating app. 36.4% of them
                    worried about getting ditched and 31.8% of them would like to know the stranger better because
                    it is
                    risky and dangerous.</p>
                <p><span class="paragraph--title">Assumptions</span></p>
                <p>Some assumptions have been made on the study place. After reviewing the survey result, we learn
                    that
                    the
                    potential users usually go to other places to study instead of cafe. That changed the features
                    that
                    I
                    planned to have, so we would leave the meeting venue open for users to fill in, instead of
                    filtering
                    the
                    coffee shops location on a Google map. We learn to not make any assumptions at the early stage
                    of
                    research.</p>

                <p>As there are many features that can be added to the app, for instance, file upload, storage
                    management,
                    chat room and so on. It could turn out to be a messenger or cloud storage app. The scope would be
                    too big and that would lose focus. </p>
                <p>This app aims for connecting people and helping the user to find a suitable study company. Therefore,
                    the
                    user profile and shared files should reflect the knowledge they have. Next step, we tried to
                    simplify
                    them in the user flow.

                </p>
                <p>We decided to use soft tone of blue to deliver a casual feeling. In order to give it more energy, we
                    also
                    chose
                    orange which is a warm color as a secondary color.</p>

                <h6>Color section of Style Guide</h6>
                <p>Using monochromatic would be too boring and the contrast of orange and blue would be too sharp, so I
                    reduced
                    the hue of them to bring a softer look.</p>
                <p class="paragraph--title">II. TYPOGRAPHY</p>
                <p>For the typography, we chose Vidaloka for the headings because it has academic and grand feelings.
                    For
                    the body, we used Assistant as it has enough spacing between each character that is able to display
                    the
                    most important information like the scheduled date and time clearly.</p>

                <h6>Logo Sketches</h6>
                <p>Option 3 looks too commercial. Option 2 and 4 were the potential logos. We chose to refine option 2
                    because a square logo is more readable and clearer when it zooms out.</p>
                <p>To present an academic feeling, we added a simple badge around the book.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph--title">I. BUTTON STYLE</p>
                    <p>We tried to use square for the CTA buttons and sign up. However, it looks a bit too serious. To
                        deliver a casual brand image, we changed them to rounded buttons.</p>

                    <p>In order to help the users to know which page they are on, we highlighted the current menu item
                        which
                        looks different from the rest of the menu.</p>

                    <p>Users will land to the homepage after they sign in or sign up an account. However, there is no
                        link
                        to go back to the homepage when the user nagivates to other pages. To solve this, we added a
                        "HOME"
                        link on the nagviation bar to bring the users back to the homepage to have an overview of the
                        confirmed and pending meetings, and friend's shared resources.</p>

                    <h4>- USABILITY TEST -</h4>
                    <p>In the usability test, we tested the processes of <span class="paragraph--title">sign-up</span>,
                        <span class="paragraph--title">checking a friend's schedule</span> and <span
                            class="paragraph--title">requesting for a
                            meeting</span>.</p>
                    <p>The result has a very high success rate. The testers understood the flow and completed the tests
                        without
                        any difficulty. The only opinion is that the logo or homepage link should usually be placed on
                        top
                        left
                        corner while the rest of the menu item should be placed on the right.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is seen as one's preference. We do not see a big issue there because there are websites
                        putting
                        logo
                        at the center and the menu items on the sides.</p>

                <p class="paragraph--title">SOLUTION</p>
                <p>Users can now search new study peers. By checking the profile, users can have a better expectation
                    and download the learning materials.</p>
                <p>Also, provided with friend's schedule, user can quickly come out a date, request a meeting with them
                    and check who is/are going.</p>
                <p class="paragraph--title">IMPROVEMENT?</p>
                <p>To highlight the dates that already have meetings on top of the calendar image, I had to bold the
                    numbers in order to cover the meeting dates on the image.
                    If I have more time, I would create the calendar myself to make sure it covers the date properly.
                </p>
                <p>Also, I would think more about the scheduling flow with a person. Can the user
                    select a date that the person is not available? Maybe that person would like to rearrange the
                    schedule for the user? To keep things simple, we decided to let the user only select the date that
                    the person is available. For now, the only solution is, if the user really wanted to meet the
