                <p>By conducting SWOT analyses for
                    WeHeartIt,
                    Pinterest and Reddit, I
                    know that sharing contents without restrictions could lead to many issues, such as spam and
                    quality
                    control. Yet, the advantage is that it provides an open door for the company to reach more
                    potential
                    customers who show particular interests that match them.

                </p>
                <p>The key information I am interested the most are
                    “Why do
                    people use cloud
                    storage and organizing app” and “What is/are the frustration(s)?” because it helped me to
                    maintain a
                    general direction. From the survey, we know that people using cloud storage and organizing
                    app for 3
                    main reasons. The top reasons are:
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/storagebuddy/surveyresult.png" class="shadow styling">
            <h5>A screenshot of survey result</h5>
            <p>“It’s common and convenient to work with the others” and “accessibility that you can get the
                files more
                than one place”.</p>
            <p>
                I need to ensure the workflows of sharing-related features, such as download and share link are
                effective. Additionally, ALL of the participants are using mobile to connect to cloud storage
                service,
                while 94.1% of them are using both computer and mobile to enjoy the cloud service. Therefore,
                besides
                doing a desktop version for the app, it is necessary to build a mobile version too.</p>
            <p>
                The second highest vote for the reason to use a cloud storage app is “to save space on my
                mobile/computer”.</p>
            <p>
                It could be seen as another group of audience who uses the cloud storage app for personal use
                besides
                collaborating with people.</p>
            <p>
                At last, “bad organization experience” comes to the most frustrating part from the users. It
                affects
                both groups of people who use the cloud storage app for their own uses and those who use it for
                collaboration. So, the organizing flow should be worth putting the most effort.</p>

            <div class="subtitle">
                <img src="images/storagebuddy/persona.png" class="icon_mobile">
                <h3>PERSONA</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Building persona gives me the idea who the users are and that would be useful to make sure
                non-designers
                are on the same page for collaboration. There are two main types of potential users that we
                learned from
                the survey.</p>
            <p>
                One is the people who want to save files for back-up or their own uses, requiring a lot of
                storage
                capacity and well-developed organizing feature, so that they can manage it and save
                space.</p>
            <p>
                The other one is using it to collaborate with people. They expect to access the files anywhere
                and share
                them effectively to people or social media. Here below are some examples.</p>

            <p>By understanding and comparing the user flows of Reddit, Pinterest and
                WeHeartIt, I
                created the user flow for Storage Buddy after examining the user stories and survey result.</p>

            <h5>A draft for all user flows</h5>
            <p>In the beginning, everything is linked together but it is hard to evaluate the process of each
                user flow
                in detail. Therefore, I finish them separately in a digital form with the information of user
                stories
                that are describing, and this contributes to the minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is common to use blue to represent profession and
                security, but
                the brand was going to be more casual, so I chose a softer color with lower chroma as the
                primary
                color.</p>
            <p>Another sharper color-yellow, which is used for drawing the user’s attention and
                driving
                them to click. I used yellow for the content and buttons on the Account Upgrade section to
                differentiate
                it from other pages because I want the user to feel that is a special part that we treat the
                valuable
                customer differently.

            <h5>Color section of Style Guide</h5>
            <p>For less important information or button such as ‘browse’ to upload a file, I would use green to
                support
                it, so that yellow still stands out among these colors. </p>

                <p class="bold">II. TYPOGRAPHY</p>
            </p>
            <p>Using Montserrat typeface for headings is modern and
                clean as
                it provides enough
                spacing between each character, making it easy to read, especially most of the headings I used
                are
                single-lined. For the body, I chose Libre Baskerville because serif type can direct the user’s
                reading.
                Again, the character spacing is not packed, resulting in comfortable reading.

                feeling of
                the app should be neutral, especially in the cloud storage market. I need to ensure the workflow
                to be
                as simple and efficient as possible. On top of that, I wanted to make the style a little bit
                casual and

                <p>These are the sketches for the logo design. I was struggling to choose the logo between No. 4 or
                    5. In
                    No. 4, it shows the brand name with the upload and download icons, I thought it was easy to
                    represent
                    the app. However, the impression it gives is serious and boring, not matching to my brand
                    character. In
                    the end, I picked no. 5 because it is simple, direct and more casual.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>During this process, I encountered many challenges and involved a lot of iterations. Here
                        below are
                        some examples.</p>
                    <p>I tried a few hero images here but the problem is the wording was too
                        hard to
                        read on a dark background. So, I added a transparent white box under it to make it more
                        visible.</p>
                    <p>Also, the icons I used in the middle of the page do not look unified.
                        Therefore, I
                        spent some time to look for some icons with a similar feeling, change their colors to my
                        primary
                        color and unify the thickness of the icon to solve it.</p>

                        the

                        did not
                        look like an option which they can switch to the sign-up page. Therefore, I changed the
                        sign-up
                        button to a subtle look with just an underline to hint the user. Also, using upper case for
                        the
                        “sign in” on the header makes the user understand where they are at.</p>

                    <p>Considered by the user behavior on mobile, color plays an important role here. From the

                        know that users upload files frequently, therefore I put the upload button at the bottom of

                    <h3>USABILITY AND PREFERENCE TESTS</h3>
                </div>
                <p>In the final round of usability test, I tested sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, upload, download,
                    share, move,
                    upgrade an account, update the profile.</p>
                <p>The feedbacks are “create a new folder” button on
                    the
                    dashboard is missing”, “MY PROFILE button is a bit outdated and not necessary” and “create a
                    sub-folder
                    quickly while moving a file”.</p>
                <p>So, I added a “create a new folder” icon on the dashboard,
                    so that
                    this feature is not only limited while moving a file. Then, I simplified the way of updating “my
                    profile” by adding a pen icon next to the profile picture to allow the user to edit it. At last,
                    I
                    created an optional form for the user to create a sub-folder at the same time while moving a
                    file.</p>

                    switching
                    the font faces for
                    heading and body.

                <h5>It is using Montserrat for heading and Libre Baskerville for body.</h5>
                <p>100% of the participants go for the second one because the concern for the readability on a
                    tablet,
                    computer and mobile, the softer look would make it clearer to read. Also, they think Montserrat
                    looks
                    modern and professional in a heading.</p>

                    <p class="bold">PREFERENCE TEST II: COLOR</p>

                <h5>Action bar in green</h5>
                <p>Although 88% of participants go for the one with a blue pop-up box due to consistency with the
                    theme
                    color. I took the comments from both sides and decided to use the green one because the contrast
                    is very
                    important to tell the user that they have selected the file and do some actions with
                    it.</p>
                <p>This
                    light up step is very important because I skipped placing all the buttons on the top right
                    corner.
                    Participants reflected that it was annoying to go back and forth to find the buttons especially
                    when
                    they already scrolled down to select the files.</p>
                <p>Another point is that the first button of
                    “select” is redundant. Users should be able to select the files by clicking them. These are the
                    takeaways from the first round of usability test. Therefore, the action buttons will only pop up
                    when
                    the user selects something, and of course, I took away the “select” button since the user can
                    directly
                    click on the file. </p>

                    usability test. I
                    thought providing the name would make it easier for the audience to understand what the app is
                    by just
                    looking at it.

                    Respondents said that it was to the point, unique and adorable.</p>

                </p>
                <p>It solved the problems of overwhelming options for each
                    event
                    for the user. The
                    action buttons like download and share icons would only appear when the user selects a file, and
                    they do not need to go back to the very top to click the action buttons.</p>
                <p>Also, I tried to
                    reduce the steps of action, such as sharing, it directly goes to the sharing link to make it
                    convenient for the user to copy it.</p>
                <p>
                    <p class="bold">IMPROVEMENT?</p>
                </p>
                <p>I think users may not know that they
                    can select more than one file at a time and unselect it by clicking on it again. A simple
                    tutorial
                    section can be added after a user sign up to improve the user experience.</p>
                <p>Another minor
                    thing
                    I can think of is, the look of thumbnail for the files can be unified, e.g. MP4, PDF, document
                    and
                    notes. So that the user can be able to understand the file types instantly.
